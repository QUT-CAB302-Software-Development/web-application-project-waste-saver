%% Calculate and visualise mean face

%% Calculate mean-centred SVD
format long % to show closeness of results

%% Visualise first 20 eigenfaces
fir_20 = A(:, 1:20); %% extract the first 20 faces
fir_20 = bsxfun(@minus, fir_20, mean_face); % difference between the mean face and the first twenty faces

% fir_20 is the difference between the first 20 image and the mean_face
% not eigenface, needed to calculate covarience to obtain the eigenvector and eigenvalue
% as the matrix for an image is 32256*1, the covarience will be 32256*32256
% which is too large for the system to handle

%% Calculate coordinate vectors
format short

c1 = Sigma(1:nu, 1:nu) * V(1, 1:nu)';  % We can now evaluate the coordinate vector for any column of U

[mean_face(:,1) U(:, 1:nu)*c1]; % The values for the first column of the mean face and the first coordinate vector match approximately
%% Demonstrate rudimentary moustache detector

    diff = double(grayscale_img(120:140, 44:124)) - curr(120:140, 44:124); % mean subtract the current image, so overexposed images will be excluded as the value becomes negative
    diff_avg = sum(diff, "all")/1701; % the average difference (0 to 255, where 0 is similar and 255 is different)
    curr_avg = sum(curr, "all")/M; % average brightness of the entire face
    mous_avg = sum(curr(120:140, 44:124), "all")/1701; % average brightness of the moustache area
    contrast = abs(curr_avg-mous_avg); % difference between entire face and the moustache area
    if diff_avg > 10 & contrast > 10
